Everytime a user takes an action(e.g. posting a news, upvote a comment), he/she gets a reward in points.
This document describes the policy for the reward system.

- A user submits a news -> 10 points
- A user comments a news/gossip -> 10 points
- A user upvotes a news -> 1 point
- A user upvotes a comment -> 1 point
- A user's news gets an upvote -> 5 points
- A user's comments gets an upvote -> 1 point

The reward policy on post/comment deletion is not set yet.
Because it is unclear that we will implement the deletion feature or not.

Refer to the database schema: [schema.ts](mdc:db/migrations/schema.ts) for the system structure.
