# Game News

This website is a community for the game developers. Anyone can share anything that is _helpful for the game
development_.

## Guidelines for the users.

_Please submit if,_

- The subject gratifies game developers' intellectual curiosity. (borrowed from HN)

_Please don't submit if,_

- The subject does not relate to the mission of the site.
- The subject is gossipy. (We already aggregate gossip for you in the /gossips page.)

_Important rules for submission:_

- It's okay to promote your product, but only if it satisfies our mission. (read above)
- Remove anything that makes the title unnecessarily attention-grabbing. It's already implicit that the content is
  important.
- Preserve the original title from the source whenever possible.

_Important rules for comments:_

- Be kind. Don't be snarky. Converse curiously; don't cross-examine. (borrowed from HN)
- Don't post shallow dismissals.
- Praise comments that are both gentle and critical.
